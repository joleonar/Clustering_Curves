# Clustering_Curves

This repositorie contains the notebook used for clustering the response spectra (curves).

For clustering the curves I've applied an algorithm for dimensionality reduction (t-SNE in this case) and then a clustering algorithm (K-means and DBSCAN).

This project was presented in the course Machine Learning for Physicists (2021)
